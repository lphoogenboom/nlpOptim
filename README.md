# Nonlinear optimization of climate control using green methods

## Runner scripts
the runner scripts are:
- nlpUnconNoPen.m
    - Uncontrolled system, with no optimization whatsoever
- nlpNoPen.m
    - Optimized system with linear constraints (nonlinear constraint possible, see comments)
- nlpMSPen.m
    - Multistart of optimized system with linear constraints and penalty function
